- title: "Route-Aware Edge Bundling for Visualizing Origin-Destination Trails in Urban Traffic"
  image: roads.png
  description: Origin-destination (OD) trails describe movements across space. Typical visualizations thereof use either straight lines or plot the actual trajectories. To reduce clutter inherent to visualizing large OD datasets, bundling methods can be used. Yet, bundling OD trails in urban traffic data remains challenging. Two specific reasons hereof are the constraints implied by the underlying road network and the difficulty of finding good bundling settings. To cope with these issues, we propose a new approach called Route Aware Edge Bundling (RAEB).

  description: We present VIStory, an interactive storyboard for exploring visual information in scientific publications. We harvest the data using an automatic figure extraction method, resulting in a large corpora of figures. Each figure contains various attributes such as dominant color and width/height ratio, together with faceted metadata of the publication including venues, authors, and keywords.
